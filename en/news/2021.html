    <dd>Our paper "<a href="https://papers.nips.cc/paper/2021/hash/adf8d7f8c53c8688e63a02bfb3055497-Abstract.html">Symplectic Adjoint Method for Exact Gradient of Neural ODE with Minimal Memory</a>," co-authored with Prof. Miyatake and Prof. Yaguchi, has been accepted at Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS). The proposed adjoint method based on a symplectic integrator obtains a gradient of an ODE with much less memory than the naive backpropagation algorithm and checkpointing schemes and faster than the ordinary adjoint method in practice.</dd>

    <dd>Our paper "<a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3474085.3475589">ChartPointFlow for Topology-Aware 3D Point Cloud Generation</a>," co-authored with Mr. Kimura and Prof. Uehara, has been accepted at ACM International Conference on Multimedia (ACMMM) as an oral presentation. Our proposed model assigns a conditioned map to each continuous subset of a point cloud, similarly to a chart of a manifold, thereby nicely generating point clouds with different topologies.</dd>
