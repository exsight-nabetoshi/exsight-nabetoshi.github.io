    <dd>Our paper "<a href="https://openreview.net/forum?id=tLScKVhcCR" target="_blank">FINDE: Neural Differential Equations for Finding and Preserving Invariant Quantities</a>," co-authored with Prof. Yaguchi, has been accepted at International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR2023). The proposed deep learning method can automatically discover and preserve conserved quantities in dynamical systems. The method is inspired by projection and discrete gradient methods.</dd>
