    <dd>Our paper "<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.08604">Deep Energy-based Modeling of Discrete-Time Physics</a>," co-authored with Dr. Ishikawa and Prof. Yaguchi, has been accepted at Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS) as an oral presentation. For modeling physical dynamical systems by neural networks, this study proposes the automatic discrete differentiation algorithm, which ensures the energy conservation and dissipation laws in discrete time.</dd>
